# My Portfolio

This is a project that  I started originaly to learn Vue and Node and decided to
turn it into my Porfolio in order to practice.

## Instalation

* Clone
* `cd Portfolio`
* `cd Client`
* `npm install`
* `cd ../Api`
* `npm install`
* Add database .env for mongoose connection

## Deploy

For deploying I'm currently using Heroku, steps needed are:

* `cd Portfolio && npm install`
* `cd client && npm run build`
* `cd ..`
* Add remote repository for heroku & push it to the heroku from master
